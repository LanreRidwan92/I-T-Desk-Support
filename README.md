# I T Desk Support Analysis Report

## Introduction

In today’s fast-paced digital environment, IT support plays a pivotal role in maintaining operational efficiency and user satisfaction. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the IT Desk support data, focusing on issue types, resolution timelines, departmental performance, and geographic trends. 

The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can enhance support delivery and optimize resource allocation.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation Process
In order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, the following data cleaning steps were performed.

* Table Creation: A new table named desk support was created specifically for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Duplicate & Null Checks: The dataset was scanned for duplicated entries and empty values, which were addressed to maintain data integrity.
* Date Formatting: Columns containing date and resolution date values were converted from text to proper date formats to enable time-based analysis.
* Column Pruning: Irrelevant columns that did not contribute to the analysis were removed to streamline the dataset.

## Insights 

* Issue Types: The most frequent issue categories are Incident and Request, indicating a high volume of operational and service-related tickets.
*Departmental Performance: Technical Support and Product Support are the busiest departments, handling 3,412 and 2,232 tickets respectively. Human Resources and General Inquiry received the fewest tickets, with 205 and 168 respectively. The Technical tag dominates usage with 3,057 instances, followed by Security (2,033) and Bug (1,253), highlighting common areas of concern.
* Resolution Time: Average resolution time across all tickets is 3 days, and High Priority tickets are resolved faster, averaging 2 days, while Medium and Low Priority tickets take 3 and 4 days respectively.
* Geographic Trends: Belgium and Sweden lead in ticket submissions with 1,240 and 1,238 respectively. Netherlands and Austria submitted the fewest tickets, with 1,138 and 1,137.
* Problem Issues: Italy and Poland face the most Problem issues, with 271 and 269 respectively. Austria and Poland are at the bottom with 236 and 228.

## Recommendations

* Prioritize High-Volume Departments: Allocate more resources to Technical and Product Support to manage high ticket volumes efficiently.
* Optimize Resolution Time: Investigate delays in Medium and Low Priority tickets to improve overall resolution speed.
* Tag-Based Training: Provide specialized training for Technical and Security issues, as these tags are most frequently used.
* Country-Specific Support: Tailor support strategies for countries with high issue volumes like Belgium, Sweden, Italy, and Poland.
* Improve Low-Performing Areas: Explore reasons behind low ticket submissions in Austria and Netherlands—could be underreporting or lack of awareness.

## Conclusion

The IT Desk support data reveals critical patterns in issue types, departmental workload, and geographic distribution. By addressing resolution inefficiencies and reallocating resources based on demand, the organization can significantly enhance its support operations. This analysis serves as a foundation for data-driven decision-making and continuous service improvement.
